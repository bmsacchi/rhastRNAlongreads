## Description
The goal of this project is to identify problems with previous kinnex pipeline that resulted in loss of X and Y sequences, and remap/classify/filter.
Mapped bams will be used for downstream RNAseq analysis, isoform identification, etc.

Samples are from R. hastatulus male and female flower buds.
